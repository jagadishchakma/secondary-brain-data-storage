$$
5)\frac{17}{2}(3
$$
- 5 is divisor
- 17 is dividend
- 3 is quotient
- 2 is reminder

# Divisibility Check
- Check if the reminder is zero:
	- 12%3 = 0 -> is divisible by 3.
	- 12%5 = 2 -> is not divisible by 5.
- Check if the quotient integer or not:
	- 12/3 = 4 -> interger -> is divisible by 3.
	- 12/5 = 2.4 -> not integer -> is not divisible by 5.
