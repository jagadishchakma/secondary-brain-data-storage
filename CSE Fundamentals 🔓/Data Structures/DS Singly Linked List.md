### Why Coming Array?
- If I want to store multiple variable in a single structure that's why coming array.
### Problem of Array
- Array store of data in a sequential in a memory.
- But If not exist enough memory in array store segment that's a problem because next segment can't allow to store array data.
- That's why come Linked List Data Structure.
- Array require a size. That's why after can't add more data.
- ==Not have enoght space every segment==
- 
### Why Coming Linked List?
- Linked list used for random access memory.
- Linked list not require size. It is randomly access and store data and linked.
### Singly Linked List
- A linked list that that linked only next data address not previous data address it is called singly linked list.
- ###### Node:
	- Node means a group that contains two values ==value== and ==next_node_pointer== .
	- End node contains two values ==value== and ==NULL== .
	- And node create using class with means user defined data type.
	- First node is called ==head== .
	- Last node is called ==tail==.
- ###### Two Value:
	- data_type name;
	- data_type(user defined data type)\* name;
- ###### Access Two Node:
	- obj.name;
	- obj.name->name or (\*obj.name).name;
- ###### Node Constructor:
	- as you know.
- ###### Node Dynamic:
	- Dynamic node means dynamic object.
	- Syntax is same.
- ###### Printing Loop Linked LIst:
	- use while loop.
	- condition is ==(tmp != NULL)==
# Phitron Recape
- Node is two part .
	- 1 part is value
	- second part is next node link
- Linked List:
	- is a combinations of node.
- Node created by class because it's holded multiple data  like group.
