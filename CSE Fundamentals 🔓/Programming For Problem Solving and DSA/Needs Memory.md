	- automatic data clear when function called.
	- can't increase of memory size but can do decrease.
	- static memory is necessary for variable.
	- ==static variable => int a  = 34;
	- ==static array => int a[3] = {1,2,3};==
- heap or dynamic or run time memory.
	- user defined data clear when function called.
	- can do increase and decresed size of memory.
	- dynamic necessary group of data,like array,object.
	- ==dynamic variable => int* a = new int(34);==
	- ==dynamic array => int* a = new int[4]{1,2,3}==
