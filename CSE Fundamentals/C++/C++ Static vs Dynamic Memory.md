# Types of Memory
- Static Memory - Stack
- Dynamic Memory - Heap

# What's Memory?
When we declare a variable, this variable statically or dynamically to store in memory. 
And different data type variable holding different memory data space.

- int = 4 bytes
- long long int = 8 bytes
- float = 4 bytes
- double = 8 bytes
- char = 1 byte

----

# Static Memory
- Limited space.
- Static memory also called compile time memory, stack memory.
- When programs compile, it's times to allocate variables to static memory.
- Static memory can't increase size of memory after once time declare. But can decrease size of memory.
- Automatic memory clear when program closed.
- Program closed means when any function return from stack. ==!important==
- Static memory for needs to normal variable.

# Dynamic Memory
- More Space.
- Dynamic memory also called runtime memory, heap memory.
- Dynamic memory allocate variable when program run any times.
- It's can do increase or decrease size of memory.
- If user instructed to will be memory clear.
- Dynamic memroy for needs to array variable.
