## BOM
- BOM => Browser Object Model.
- ## **BOM === window**  object.
- BOM === window === DOM === JS = Tree Data Structure.
## Key - Point
- The **window** object is accessible globally in JavaScript. Any variable or function declared globally becomes a property or method of the **window** object.
- When we access window object any property or method don't need to mention window object name.
- You can't create instance of window object because it is provided by browser environment.
