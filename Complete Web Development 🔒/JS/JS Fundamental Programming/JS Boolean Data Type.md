## Declare
- var check = true;
- var check = false;
## Behind The Scene 
- JS no needs to declare string(string,char) data type:
	- JS Engine automatically recognize data type.
	- JS Engine then threads a ==Boolean== class template for this string data and create a ==Boolean== built in object.
		- as well as:
			- also JS Engine threads a Global ==Boolean== object.
	- JS Engine then create ==some built-in function or method== for manipulate boolean data in this class, and uses c++ boolean header file or something related header file in this class. 
		- ==boolean Property:
			- Boolean.prototype
		- ==boolean Methods:
			- bool.toString();
			- bool.valuOf();
	- JS Engine then into the class detective string ==type(bool)== and according to manage memory. 
	- JS Engine memory manage means to store bool data in ==stack memory or heap memory==  for primitive  or reference values;
		- ==Stack memory store:
			- var bool = Boolean(true);
			- var bool = false;
		- ==Heap memory store:
			- var bool = new Boolean(true);
